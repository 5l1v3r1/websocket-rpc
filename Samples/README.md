Samples
=====================

The recommendation is to run samples in the following order (from the more simple ones to more complex ones):

1. ServerClientSample
2. ServerClientJs
3. MultiService
4. Serialization
5. AspRpc

**Remarks**  
+ If a sample contains JavaScript client, the additional step is to open the included Index.html.
+ Samples that contain multiple executables have 'Run.bat' for one-click run.
